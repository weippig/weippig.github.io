Leetcode Top Interview 150 的其中一題

## 題目描述
Given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which begins with a slash `'/'`, transform this path into its simplified canonical path.

In Unix-style file system context, a single period `'.'` signifies the current directory, a double period `".."` denotes moving up one directory level, and multiple slashes such as `"//"` are interpreted as a single slash. In this problem, treat sequences of periods not covered by the previous rules (like `"..."`) as valid names for files or directories.

The simplified canonical path should adhere to the following rules:

It must start with a single slash `'/'`.
Directories within the path should be separated by only one slash `'/'`.
It should not end with a slash `'/'`, unless it's the root directory.
It should exclude any single or double periods used to denote current or parent directories.
Return the new path.

## 範例
### Example 1:
```
Input: path = "/home/"

Output: "/home"

Explanation:

The trailing slash should be removed.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"

Output: "/home/foo"

Explanation:

Multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: path = "/../"

Output: "/"

Explanation:

Going one level up from the root directory is not possible.
```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= path.length <= 3000
- path consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.
- path is a valid absolute Unix path.

## 解法
``` go 
func simplifyPath(path string) string {
    if len(path) == 1 { return path }

    folders := make([]string, 0)
    path += "/"
    bytes := make([]byte, 0)

    for i:=1; i<len(path); i++ {
        if path[i] != '/' {
            bytes = append(bytes, path[i])
            continue
        } 

        if len(bytes) == 0 { continue }

        if len(bytes) == 1 && bytes[0] == '.' { 
            bytes = []byte{}
            continue
        }

        if len(bytes) == 2 && bytes[0] == '.' && bytes[1]=='.' {
            if len(folders) > 0 { folders = folders[:len(folders) - 1] }
            bytes = []byte{}
            continue
        } 

        folders = append(folders, string(bytes))
        bytes = []byte{}
    }

    res := ""

    for _, s := range folders {
        res += "/"
        res += s
    }

    if len(res)  == 0 { return "/"}

    return res
}
```
